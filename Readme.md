# M2_MiniProject_LaneChangeAssist

The drivers especially two wheeler drivers are prone to make mistakes during lane changing without considering the other vechicles on the road. This project assists them during lane changing and alarms them if their decision of lane changing is incorrect by taking into consideration, all other nearby vechicles on the road.
